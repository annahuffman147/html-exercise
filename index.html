    <h2>Where have I lived?</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in Oakland, California and my family moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan when I was 6 months old.
      My mom was a single mom of four children under 6 years old as she returned to college. Upon graduation, she moved us to Fremont, Michigan where she got her first job.
      I went to Michigan State University in East Lansing and moved to Detroit after graduation to volunteer in a group home.
      Two years later, I moved to Brownsburg, Indiana to support my sister who had left her abusive husband.....

        I toured five countries in Europe when I was in high school and would love to revisit Switzerland.
        I want to go to Hawaii, but avoid the tourist areas.
